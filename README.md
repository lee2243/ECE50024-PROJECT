# ECE50024-PROJECT
Repo that contains code used in ECE50024 implementation of the paper "Learning with Noisy Labels"

This code compares the baseline method "vanilla SVM" and the implementation of LNL "SVM using unbiased estimators".

There are multiple datset loaders in this one file. Comment out or change to markdown the dataset you are not using unless all the dataset used in the code will default to UCI Breast Cancer dataset.
